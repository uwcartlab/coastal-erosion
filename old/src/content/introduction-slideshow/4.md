The toe of the bluff, the intersection of bluff and beach, is one of the most dynamic parts of the bluff. Depending on lake levels, weather conditions and the condition of the beach itself, the toe may be exposed directly to the wavesâ€”a major cause of bluff erosion.

This image provides a great look at glacial till exposed at the bluff toe due to wave energy coming in contact with the bluff.
