                            <h2><b>Erosion Processes</b></h2>
                            <p>There are many factors to consider when talking about bluff erosion. The six factors listed below cover the majority of issues. </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Wave Action</li>
                                <li>Lake Level</li>
                                <li>Surface Runoff</li>
                                <li>Groundwater</li>
                                <li>Freeze & Thaw</li>
                                <li>Wind</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                Bluffs are a dynamic part of the landscape, continuously changing, moving toward a stable slope angle. 
                                For bluffs in this area that are composed of glacial till, the stable angle is approximately 22-degrees.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The bluff in the 3D animation has become steeper over time, from a slope angle of 17-degrees to 24-degrees. 
                                The toe of the bluff has receded landward about 106' while the bluff top has only receded about 14 over the same time period.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The diagram below shows the causes of erosion and some of the effects like "seeps" and surface erosion like "rills" and "gullies. 
                                Each "erosion factor" is highlighted in the diagram on this page and on the following pages to describe each erosion factor.

                            <h2><b>Wave Action</b></h2>
                            <p>
                                The primary cause of bluff erosion occurs when waves hit the bluff toe, leading to bluff instability. 
                                The intensity and duration of storm activity strongly influences waves, that in turn determines how much damage the waves will cause at the shoreline. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Wave power is determined primarily by wind speed, duration and the open water distance (fetch) over which the wind is in contact with the water surface. 
                                As wind speed, duration and fetch increase, so does wave power.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Wave power is lessened as the waves break in the near-shore due to a shallow lakebed. 
                                The shallow lakebed is maintained by a continuous resupply of sediment due to erosion. 
                                If the sediment supply is restricted due to shoreline protection, the lakebed may erode, allowing greater wave energy to come into contact with the shoreline.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Periods of great shoreline damage and property loss are related more to times of high wave power than to times of peak water levels.

                            <h2><b>Lake Levels</b></h2>
                            <p>
                                Lake Michigan water levels vary due to climatic conditions that affect the entire drainage basin. 
                                Levels can vary from season to season, over several years or over tens years or more. 
                                Humans influence, but nature controls the water levels of the Great Lakes. 
                                The human influence is limited to few inches while the natural cycles, seasonal and long-term, will affect water levels by several feet (see "Lake Michigan Water Levels" chart.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As mentioned before, waves contacting the shoreline lead to the most damage. 
                                While high lake levels will aid to increase shoreline damage during storms, similar damage can occur during low water level periods. 
                                Storm surges, seiches and edge waves create conditions of temporary water level rise at the shoreline, allowing waves to reach the beach or base of a bluff.

                            <h2><b>Surface Runoff</b></h2>
                            <p>
                                Water flowing over the ground during intense storms can contribute to large amounts of soil erosion in very short time periods. 
                                The duration, intensity and amount of rainfall are important factors to consider when thinking about surface runoff, but other factors such as type of surface must also be considered.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Vegetation shields the soil from the direct impact of rain drops and helps holds the soil in place with its root structure, where hard surfaces such as parking lots concentrate flow that can lead to increased erosion.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Human impacts on the surface affect where and how fast water flows. If flow is concentrated into a small area it can break apart and move larger amounts of soil due to how fast the water is flowing and the depth of flow.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Rills and gullies are the result of surface runoff. Gullies become the collection point for runoff, promoting even greater loss of sediment during intense rainfall. 
                                The head of the gully eats back into the bluff at different rates than normal bluff top erosion, usually faster, threatening any structures near by.

                            <p>
                                The hidden activity of groundwater can be more dangerous than the visible effects of surface water, because groundwater can trigger large, deep landslides or slumps.
                                Water in soil pores and fractures beneath a slope weakens the soils by adding weight and reducing fictional forces that hold the soil particles together.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Groundwater can buildup and flow between different soil layers, especially in more-permeable layers such as the sandy lake sediment layer between "till 1" and "till 2" in the diagram below. 
                                When groundwater flow from these layers reaches the bluff it emerges in the form of seeps or springs. 
                                The image to the right displays a small seep located at the bottom of a bluff.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Surface water infiltrating into the ground can cause the soil to become saturated due to natural causes such as rain or by human influences like watering the lawn. 
                                The amount of water, the duration it infiltrates into the soil and the structure of the soil all play important roles.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Coastal slump problems develop primarily where there are zones of water saturation above the lower, main water table, these are called perched groundwater tables, as shown in the image below. 
                                Off-site groundwater sources, septic systems and dry wells also contribute to groundwater flow and/or retention.

                            <p>
                                In Wisconsin, the seasonal changes create the situation where the ground will go through freeze-thaw cycles. 
                                As water freezes in soil pores, the ground expands causing potential landslides or slumps at that time. 
                                When the soil thaws it becomes saturated from the water contained within the bluff and also from snow melting on the surface.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A bluff will be least stable during times of greatest infiltration due to heavy precipitation or rapid thawing of significant snow cover. 
                                The weight of the saturated soil and the changes in the frictional properties of the soils provide opportunities for large or small scale landslides or slumping.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The spring thaw period creates an environment for significant erosion along the top of the bluff. 
                                Many factors exist during the spring that don't exist during the rest of the year, including: heavy spring rain; increased runoff due to semi-frozen ground; saturated surface soils due to thaw; limited protection of ground due to minimal tree canopy (no leaves); and potential of rapid snowmelt.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The winter freeze and spring thaw work together, breaking apart the soil and removing the cohesive properties that might exist, resulting in bluff erosion in the form of slumps or slides. The image on the right shows the potential of this situation.

                            <h2><b>Wind</b></h2>
                            <p>
                                Wind impacts the shoreline in three ways: 
                                1. as the main cause of waves 
                                2. by moving loose sediment on the bluff 
                                3. and by shoving ice against the shore
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It was mentioned previously that surface waves are generated as wind blows across the wave surface. 
                                The duration, speed and direction of wind affects the water surface. Wave height and period (frequency between waves) increases as wind speed and fetch (distance that wind blows along surface) increases, which is directly related to wave energy - the leading cause of erosion along a shoreline.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Wind has a larger impact on sandy shorelines where it can move large amounts of sediment toward or away from the shore. On bluffs, sediment that has been mechanically weathered due to freeze-thaw may be moved from the surface to the toe of the bluff - this process is minimal.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Winter ice that forms along the shoreline can be moved directly by the wind or indirectly due to wave action. Ice can scour the lakebed, causing downcut, or can collect sediment within the ice. In both cases large amounts of sediment can be moved and in the case of lakebed downcutting, the natural protection of a shallow lakebed can be removed allowing wave energy to impact closer to shore.
