    <h6>Coastal Erosion on the Great Lakes</h6>
    <br />
    <p>
      Erosion affects Wisconsinâ€™s coastal communities in ways that are not intuitive and, thus, not fully appreciated by many public officials, planners and real estate developers.  Lakefront property is desirable, yet it has an inherent instability that is linked to certain land-use practices. We seek to bridge the gap between scientific understanding and public perception of these practices and their effects by utilizing web-based geovisualization tools and remotely-sensed data to present integrated and scientifically informed views of coastal erosion.
