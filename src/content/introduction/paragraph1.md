###### Introduction

Living along the coast requires that we understand how erosion works so that we can avoid putting people and buildings in dangerous locations. Although the shape and location of the bluffs may look very stationary to our eyes, have a look at the multimedia visualizations over the next several pages and you'll see just how much they change over time.

The animations, aerial photography, pictures, charts and text included in the following pages will seek to educate and inform the public about:
* coastal dynamics due to natural processes
* impacts by local land development decisions
* and that this change is continuous
